    <p>Fresh pasta is not something to master in one go. It takes time and practise, but it yields dividents. This
        perticular recipe is vastly versatile. It can be made into while grain pasta, by swapping in 1 cup sifted whole
        wheat, spelt or farro flour in place of 1 cup all-purpose or 00 flour. Add more egg yolks or water as needed and
        rest the dough for 1 hour. Or try a gteen pasta, as in this ravioli verdi: Steam or saute 6 ounces baby spinach
        (about 6 cups) until just wilted. Spread it out on a parchment-lined baking sheet, and, when cool squeeze water
        out thoroughly, a handful at a time, then chop roughly. Puree with 2 eggs and 1 egg yolk, then use this mixture
        in place of eggs in the recipe. Or, for something a little different, make an herbed pasta, like this
        pappardelle, by stirring in <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup finely chopped parsley, chives, chervil, tarragon, or
        basil in any combination to the eggs before adding to the flour in the main recipe.</p>
